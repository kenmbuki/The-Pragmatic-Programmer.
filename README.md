# The-Pragmatic-Programmer.
#### Summary Notes - a recompilation of Knowledge acquired


### 1. Chapter 1 - The pragmatic philosophy

Be honest, Be responsible about of the real situation of the project, if you can’t finish at the deadline or maybe you are experiencing some problems give to your boss a possible solution for those problems, don’t make child excuses like: __The cat ate my code__. Do not provide lame excuses - instead provide options

Software Enthropy/disorder. __The Broken Window__ an entire neighborhood gets down to the misery, all caused for a broken window,that suddenly brings another broken window and people start to be negligent with the buildings, then appears graffiti and it was too late to repair anything soon everything was a complete disaster. The same thing happens with our code, if we leave bugs to be repaid at the end of the project, maybe that could be too late to make it, and soon you will be collecting the bits of code from the floor.

....In the other hand we have a __case of firefighters__, who dont want to mess a burning down house, only because it was perfectly clean, full of valuable things, no one wants to be the first to mess beautiful things. The same happens in our projects, if you test and repair all the bugs, relay good documentation with comments, a modular and scalable feature, no one want to be the first adding a poor code and downgrading you feature.

In __The stone soup__; two hungry soldiers’ tricks to the habitants of the village, who doesn’t want to give them some food, making a “delicious” stone soup, the villagers dying because of their curiosity was tricked making them bring more vegetables to make the soup even more delicious. In the same way pragmatic programmers, got to impress the sponsors if no body trusts in your project, make a prototype to demonstrate the functionality, everyone wants to jump into the ship of victory. Be a catalyst for change

In the other hand we have the tale of __Boiled frog__; the book says that a pragmatic programmer got to be aware of the main problems of the project, even if it is a big project with many developers consider the whole picture, and be able to refactor when things aren’t well, if you continue developing a system that is a closed street then you wouldn’t be able to see you are getting slowly boiled, like happened to the frogs.

__Good enough software__; Sometimes we can´t continue tuning our projects, because many factors are involved in, like deadlines and budgets, but if we have an application whit all the requirements satisfy, well designed, tested and scalable we have to recognize that our project is finished and understand that nobody write perfect code. Do not give priority to the fancy features over the requirements. I agree with the concept that is better a great software today than a perfect software tomorrow, involve your users in the in the process of develop, every now and then give them something to play whit, this make them happy and solid relationships.

__Eaten worm__; if we neglect our Knowledge we are in danger to become obsolete for our company, even if it is about older technologies, we have to be always in the craft, don’t be the early worm eaten by the early bird. Making an inversion in our knowledge always will amply reward.

__Manage you knowledge portfolio__; like a business portfolio, always diversify it, try to be an eminence in one technology and then learn about others. in addition to the knowledge portfolio, learn a programming language per year, read a technique book of something else once a year, take some courser in technology events, join actively a group of knowledge a participle often, try with different environments like linux if you use only windows or with some new framework for your preferred programming languages, and even more. and finally always take a chance to learn helping others to solve their problems.

__Keep a critical thinking__; always spend some time researching for the best technologies, sometimes it isn’t in the surface, and the first products in the advices of your browser pay to be there.

__Keep in touch__; we need to communicate in so many levels, with our boss, with our team, the users, the clients, if we don’t do it correctly all our knowledge is a waste of time. Know what you want to say, always think if that you want to ask is the real question, remember a good communication is the key to save some important time, no matter if is only a e-mail or a phone call, have some respect for the time of the others.

__Choose your moment__; if your boss is in an important meeting or he is stressed by some problem, maybe is not good time to ask for a better salary or increasing the bad news, so wait for a better moment, sometimes you know what they are going to say, so avoid them an awful conversation and work on you problem.

__Choose your style__; you need to know the people that you are having communication with, some of them like an extensive summary in paper, and some of them just a simple e mail whit the main information resumed in a list.

__Make it looks good__; the information needs a good format, if looks unordered it will be ignored.

__Always answer to the people__; if you have a large list of emails without review, it’s time to start to answers them; maybe your answer is more important to them than the offence of your late.
