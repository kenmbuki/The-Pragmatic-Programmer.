# The-Pragmatic-Programmer.
#### Summary Notes - a recompilation of Knowledge acquired


### 1. Chapter 1 - The pragmatic philosophy

..* Be honest, Be responsible about of the real situation of the project, if you can’t finish at the deadline or maybe you are experiencing some problems give to your boss a possible solution for those problems, don’t make child excuses like: __The cat ate my code__. Do not provide lame excuses - instead provide options

..* Software Enthropy/disorder. __The Broken Window__ an entire neighborhood gets down to the misery, all caused for a broken window,that suddenly brings another broken window and people start to be negligent with the buildings, then appears graffiti and it was too late to repair anything soon everything was a complete disaster. The same thing happens with our code, if we leave bugs to be repaid at the end of the project, maybe that could be too late to make it, and soon you will be collecting the bits of code from the floor.

In the other hand we have a case of firefighters, who dont want to mess a burning down house, only because it was perfectly clean, full of valuable things, no one wants to be the first to mess beautiful things. The same happens in our projects, if you test and repair all the bugs, relay good documentation with comments, a modular and scalable feature, no one want to be the first adding a poor code and downgrading you feature.
